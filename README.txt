 pseudo code for the program that finds the greatest prime factor between 2 numbers:-

1. we input to numbers into the veriables (a,b).
2. we do a loop "for" for(int i=2; i<=a/2; i++) to get all the numbers between 2<=a/2.
3. we do a condition if(a%i==0 && b%i==0) to check if the number is common fact with the 
numbers we inputed (a,b).
4. if the condition is true we do .
a=a/i wich divise the number in the variable "a" whith the number in the variable "i".
primeF=i we put the value of the variable "i" in the variable "primeF".
5. we do another condition if(primeF==1).
if the condition is true we print out that there is no prime factor.
if the condition is not true we print out the number in the variable "primeF"
is the greatest prime factor.
